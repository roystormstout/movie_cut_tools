All data is in directory:


/home/wwwroot/default/src


All full movies (transpiled to mp4) are stored in the following format :


/home/wwwroot/default/src/movie/movieid.mp4


(replace all ‘movieid’ with actual id of movies, eg: ‘tt1234567’)


Movie shots are in subdirectory:


/home/wwwroot/default/src/movie/movieid/ 


Shots informations are in:


/home/wwwroot/default/src/movie/shots_info/ 


All movieid.txt files are the original shots cut time, we reprocessed them into movieid.clips.json which combines short shots to minimize the error produced during cutting.


To cut transpiled movies into movie shots or to get keyframe screenshots, run the following command:


python cut_automated.py
